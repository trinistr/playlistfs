- (?) use lstat instead of stat for original files when building table
- handle dereferencing or not of symlinks
- (?) actually implement atime touching (though shouldn't it just work?)
- --unmount/-u option (use fusermount -u / umount)
- (?) redo --no-relative-* as positive options and flags
- (?) add option to mount over non-empty directory (will always work in FUSE 3 anyway)
- Fix memory leaks in operations
- Add optional failures when something can't be accessed instead of skipping
- (?) s/PATH_MAX/NAME_MAX + 1/
- Impose (large) limits on paths to prevent runaway allocation
- Use our own inode numbers (and track them)
- Don't rename file to itself, see rename(2)
- Don't use default_permissions, as it prohibits things like link(2) on files not owned by user
- (?) Remove "playlist" from auto-generated directory name
- (?) Add an option --no-relative-lists to disable relative paths to lists themselves
