- --unmount/-u option (use fusermount -u / umount)
- (?) redo --no-relative-* as positive options and flags
- Add optional failures when something can't be accessed instead of skipping
- (?) Impose (large) limits on paths to prevent runaway allocation
- Don't use default_permissions, as it prohibits things like link(2) on files not owned by user
- (?) Remove "playlist" from auto-generated directory name
- (?) Add an option --no-relative-lists to disable relative paths to lists themselves
- Change playlist format:
  - Prohibit bytes < 0x20 (control codes) (and we don't care about non-ASCII-compatible encodings)
  - Add comments
  - Add magic (in comment) to detect MIME type
  - Add file name mapping
- Add final list of files in a hidden file inside directory
  - Use it for magic too!
- Make --symlinks actually behave the same as --symlink
